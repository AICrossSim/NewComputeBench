# NewComputeBench

**[AICrossSim/NewComputeBench](https://github.com/AICrossSim/NewComputeBench)** is a benchmark suite for new compute paradigms (Spiking neural networks, Optical computation, In-Memory computation, etc) via software emulation. The project consists of three main components:

- Model Training
- Model Behavior-Level Simulation
- Hardware-Performance Simulation (`ðŸš§ TODO`)

## What's New

- ðŸš© **15th April Milestone**: System and model-level training simulation (SLM):
    1. Environment setup: [Tutorial](env-setup.md)
    2. Pretraining AICrossSim LLMs (60M, 200M, 400M, 600M, 1.1B) & evaluation: [Tutorial](01-model-training/llm-pretrain.md)
    3. Software-emulated bitflip-aware pretraining & evaluation: [Tutorial](02-model-behaviour-level-simulation/llm-bitflip.md)
